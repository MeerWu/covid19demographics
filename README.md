There are many different factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19, and our analysis aims to identify the factors that contribute the most to the spread. Through our linear regression and PCA analysis, we discovered that there are mainly 5 factors contributing to the countywide growth of coronavirus-infected individuals - the factors are the number of people enrolled in Medicare, the number of hospitals, respiratory mortality rate, population density, and the start date of limiting gatherings with more than 50 people.

The *Final Project* Jupyter notebook contains a detailed walk-through of our entire modeling process, from EDA to comparing the performances of various regression models.
